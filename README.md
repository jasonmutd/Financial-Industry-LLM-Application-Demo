# Financial Industry LLM Applications Demo

This repository demonstrates practical applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the financial industry, with a focus on enterprise deployment strategies and real-world use cases.

## 🎯 Overview

This short artical explores different approaches to implementing LLM solutions in financial institutions, addressing key concerns such as:
- Customer service enhancement
- Data privacy and security
- Cost-effectiveness and scalability

## 🏗 Architecture and Implementation

### 1. Current LLM Capabilities in Enterprises
Modern LLM suites primarily operate through **chat-based interfaces**, making them effective at:
- Document processing and summarization
- Language translation
- General text-based tasks

### 2. Technical Implementation Paths: Open-Source vs. Closed-Source Solutions

#### 2.1  Open-Source LLMs: Ollama & Open WebUI  
[Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/tree/main/docs) and [Open WebUI](https://docs.openwebui.com/) are examples of open-source tools that enable flexible customization of LLM applications.  

**Problem:** One major challenge for LLMs is **hallucination, especially in numerical calculations**. Even with state-of-the-art reasoning models including DeepSeek R1 and OpenAI O1, miscalculations can occur.  

**Solution:** Open WebUI allows users to define external tools to perform accurate computations.  

**Key Features:**
- Local deployment capabilities
- Custom tool integration
- Mathematical computation enhancement
  - Addresses LLM calculation limitations
  - Demonstrates tool-augmented reasoning
  - Custom calculator integration for accurate computations

🎥 View Demo: Enhanced Mathematical Computations demonstrates how Open WebUI integrates with a math computation tool to mitigate hallucination risks. In this video, I am able to deploy various state-of-art open source model locally including llama3.3 and deepseek-r1 70b reasoning model, but unfortunately, in my first trial, which I did not record in the video, neither of the models could give me a correct number for two large numbers multiplication. In the recorded video, deepseek-r1 70b gives me a correct answer after 5 mins of thinking and reasoning. And Open WebUI allows me to define my own calculator in Python and the model is able to call this tool internally to do math calculation.

#### 2.2 Closed-Source LLMs: Anthropic Claude & MCP
[Anthropic Claude](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/mcp) provides a **closed-source enterprise solution** with **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, enhancing LLM capabilities in enterprise applications.

**Solution:** MCP allows seamless integration of Desktop Claude with **private databases**, enabling **custom workflows** through natural language input.  

**Key Features:**
- Secure database connectivity
- Natural language data analysis
- Enterprise-grade security measures
- Advanced data processing capabilities

🎥 View Demo: Database Integration shows how users can query structured sales data and perform automated processing via Claude + MCP. This sqlite database is on premise and Claude Desktop (not the online version) allows model to connect to personal database to do further analysis.

#### 2.3 Comparative Analysis: Open Source vs. Closed Source

| Aspect | Open Source | Closed Source |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Deployment Cost | Low, easy to implement | Higher, requires dedicated team and subscription-based |
| Security | Local deployment possible | Enterprise-grade security |
| Performance & Reliability | May require fine-tuning & external tools | Generally more optimized for enterprise |
| Customization | High – fully configurable | May require vendor support |
| Maintenance | Community-dependent | Vendor-supported |

**Enterprise Deployment Considerations:**
- Cost-effective proof-of-concept with open-source tools
- Hybrid deployment possibilities
- Compliance with financial regulations
- Data privacy protection
- Risk management integration

> **Conclusion:**  
> - Open-source LLMs offer flexibility but require extensive security measures.  
> - Closed-source LLMs provide enterprise-grade security but with limited control.  
> - **Hybrid approaches** may be ideal for financial institutions, where sensitive data processing is done on **on-premise LLMs**, while **public-facing tasks leverage cloud-based APIs**.

### 3. Agentic AI Implementation
Agentic AI enhances LLM capabilities by allowing **tool usage, multistep reasoning, and self-iteration**.

**Problem** I have the impression that, right before an Apple event, the stock price tends to dip and then rise the following day. To validate this assumption, I created an agentic flow to assist with the analysis.

**Key Features:**
- Rapid deployment framework
- Personalization options
- Tool Usage
- Mulstep Reasoning
- Self-iteration
